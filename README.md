# test-merge
Inspired by a repo I was working in where the develop branch was behind main, I wanted to see if it was possible to fix merge conflicts on the target branch and update a PR. I found that fixing on the target branch would create a merge commit, which upon pushing to GitHub would auto close the PR (see PR [#1](https://github.com/sirchras/test-merge/pull/1)). I don't think that this way of structuring repos is good practice, a dev branch which is behind the master branch will just increase the likelihood of new changes in dev conflicting with existing upsteam changes. Changes should be made in feature branches and merged to dev, and any hotfix patch branches must be merged both to main and dev (dev should be ahead of main) - [GitFlow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
